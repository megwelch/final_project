    <p class="bio">Dave is a Baltimore native that first found his love for woodcraft in his seventh grade shop class. He is an engineer by day, but on any given night or weekend he can most likely be found in his workshop covered in sawdust. Dave really began his woodworking hobby by making Christmas ornaments. His closest friends and family have ornaments that are dated back to 1999 and receiving a new ornament every year is a tradition that they cherish. Later, Dave's uncle introduced woodturning to him which quickly became his passion. In fact, he was so passionate about it that in 2008 he became a wood turning instructor at a local shop. Over the years, there has been no limit to what Dave can create. While wood-turned bowls are probably his favorite, he also enjoys making furniture, pens, and so much more. With his undeniable passion, there truly isn't anything that Dave can't make if he sets his mind to it.</p>
